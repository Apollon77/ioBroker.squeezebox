# ioBroker Logitech Squeezebox Adapter

Controls a Squeezebox Server a.k.a. Logitech Media Server and its players.

## Install

Install this adapter via ioBroker Admin.

1. Open instance config dialog
2. Enter the IP address or host name of your Squeezebox Server
3. Lower the time update interval value if you have enough performance in your system.
4. Save the configuration
5. Start the adapter

## Configuration
### Logitech Media Server Address
This is the IP address or host name of your Squeezebox Server.
The server must listen to telnet commands on TCP port 9090 (don't confuse this with the web (HTTP) port which will always be a different one).

### Track time update interval (sec)
Every N seconds the elapsed time of playing tracks is updated.
Leave this at 5 seconds if you are not using this for visualization.
If you need more precision, set it to 2 or 1 seconds.

## States

The adapter automatically connects to the configured Squeezebox Server and creates the following states for each player connected to the Squeezebox Server.

The names of the states are formatted like this: squeezebox.&lt;instance&gt;.&lt;player&gt;.&lt;state&gt;
- &lt;instance&gt; is the ioBroker adapter instance index (usually "0")
- &lt;player&gt; is the name you gave to the player when configuring it (spaces are replaced by underscores "_")
